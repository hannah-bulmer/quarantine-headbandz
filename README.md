# HEADS UP: QUARANTINE EDITION

Prerequisites:
- at this time, you will need a gmail account to make this work
- your gmail account needs to permit access from less secure apps, because the python backend does not use security to the level google would like. This program does not store your email password anywhere
    - go to (Less Secure Apps)[https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps] to update this

To play:
Download the files in this repo and place them in a folder. In `emails.txt`, add a list of all the players names and emails as follows:
```text
Hannah hannah@example.com
John john@example.com
Robert robert123@example.com

```
#### NOTE: it is VITALLY important to leave a new line at the end of this file until this is patched

Now, navigate into the folder that holds all your files in the terminal/commandline.

Run `python3 headbands.py` and follow the instructions.

Every player will be sent an email with the characters for everyone else playing headbands with them! It might be helpful to jot these down on a pad of paper in front of you as you enjoy a fun game during this time of self isolation.
